remaining sessions and assessments 
by Andrew Maclachlan - Tuesday, 12 March 2024, 12:51 PM 
  
Hi everyone
Sadly I am unwell today but Ollie will be giving the lecture at 1pm. 
Several students have asked questions about the assessment and I have 
addressed them below. Please read all of this message. 
Learning diary
For the learning diary entries we are expecting:
*	week 1 - intro to remote sensing
*	week 2 - short presentation - see practical book for requirements
*	week 3 - corrections
*	week 4 - policy - see practical book for requirements
*	week 5 - no entry required
reading week
*	week 6 - intro to GEE
*	week 7 - classification
*	week 8 - classification 2
*	week 9 - SAR or temperature (the practical is a choice between SAR 
and temperature)
*	week 10 - no entry required
Re-read the marking scheme and assessment requirements! 
The deadline is 5pm Friday 22nd March and this is again taken from the last 
commit. You must not submit (commit and push) after this deadline. 
Group presentations 
Re-read the marking scheme and assessment requirements! 
*	Groups will have 10 minutes only to present their pitch. I will stop you 
at 10 minutes. Be under, or on time.
*	It must use Quarto or Xaringan
*	The submission will be the live presentation itself - you will present 
either on Tuesday or Thursday. 
*	We will take 2-3 questions per group (excluded from the 10 minutes). 
The previous group will be required to propose at least 1 question. 
*	Please can everyone complete this form by Friday (15th), so I know 
who is in which group: https://forms.gle/7cQCMpcoSUjVA18M8
*	I will divide the groups across our sessions on Tuesday and Thursday 
next week and publish a schedule. I expect everyone to respect each 
other's work and commitment by attending both sessions.  
Please ask any questions on slack. 
 
Andy
