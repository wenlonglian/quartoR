## Summary
Continuing from Lecture 7, this session delved deeper into the questions surrounding classification techniques and emphasized the importance of accuracy in remote sensing. It highlighted the **METHODS** in accurately classifying like Subpixels, OBIA, interpreting remote sensing data.

### Accuracy assessment includes several points
- how to assess different type of **image analysis** (superpicel, pixels, mixels (mixed pixel), mixed objects)
- What data should be used to assess accuracy(best approach-cross validation)
- how to assess?(Error matrix, Kappa)


### practical result
  The second lesson, delved into different clustering methods and different object types classification. It introduce different image analysis rules(OBIA), subpixels....And what we are doing in this practical is to compare the difference between subpixel and OBIA.
  
  Specific explaination and how they should be matched to appropriate classification method. It introduced me to k-means clustering and Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) as methods to reduce pixel data into more manageable objects for classification.

  But in fact,I think the practical introduction could be more **specific**, there are some points could be ambiguous.Like defining the end member.

## Application

  In exploring the application of remote sensing classification and accuracy, several studies have demonstrated innovative uses of these methods. For instance, a study by [Jenerowicz et al. (2018)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2325809) utilized satellite imagery classification to monitor urban areas in Warsaw, Poland, showcasing the potential of remote sensing in environmental conservation efforts. Similarly, [Alzahrani and Kanan (2022)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/5190193) applied these techniques to urban planning, enabling the detailed analysis of urban sprawl and its impact on local ecosystems. Lastly, a groundbreaking study by [Chen (2021)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3510858.3511007) explored the accuracy of remote sensing data in predicting environmental changes, highlighting the importance of precision in environmental disaster management. These examples illustrate the versatility and critical importance of remote sensing classification and accuracy across various fields, from environmental conservation to urban planning and disaster management. The innovative approaches adopted in these studies reflect both the capabilities and the ongoing development of remote sensing technologies, echoing the methodologies discussed in our course.


## Reflection

In this week, we explored the whole process of data classification, not only the mothods, but also how to validate its accuracy, what should we concern about,spatial correlation?A bit familiar to GIS...I think it's a useful week that can be really used in project.However, the practical only include the classfying methods, and we dont have chance to know how to validate it in software,and the codes??Look forward to more details!!

The advancements in classifying methods in images, coupled with the development of sophisticated analysis techniques, present exciting opportunities for environmental science.
