# Week2: Xaringen and Quarto

This week we learnt Xaringen and Quarto which are tools to make presentation and html with code. It is a better way to make presentation more accessible and mergible for different codes.

## Summary

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width='50%'}
xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(
  url = "https://wenlonglian.github.io/sensor/",
  ratio = "4:3")

```

## SAR Application

### How SAR Data is used?

In the research, SAR data is collected using spaceborne radar sensors that emit signals towards the Earth and measure the reflections. This process allows for the detailed observation of the Earth's surface, including subtle deformations.

### How SAR Data is analysed?

The analysis of SAR data involves advanced techniques such as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). InSAR utilizes the phase differences in the radar signals received over multiple passes to detect even slight changes in the Earth's surface, such as those caused by underground movements or reservoir changes. This method enables accurate monitoring of ground deformation, which is critical in understanding the dynamics of reservoirs and their impact on the surrounding environment.

## Reflection

This week is a challenge to use new tool to produce presentation, Xaringen and Quarto. Amazing to know this advanced skill which can help my job hunting. Though I find it a bit hard to use.
