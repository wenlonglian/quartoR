Key learning outcomes include:\n\nUnderstanding the differences between Landsat and Sentinel data.\nPerforming basic raster image statistics and processing.\nEvaluating the advantages and disadvantages of each type of software used.\nExtracting and comparing spectral signatures.\n\n\n\n\nSNAP interface\n\n\n\n\n4 Application\n\nForest Monitoring Coppin, P., & Bauer, M. E. (1996). Digital change detection in forest ecosystems with remote sensing imagery. Remote Sensing Reviews, 13(3-4), 207-234. utilized Landsat data to track deforestation and forest degradation over time. The study employed digital change detection techniques to analyze temporal variations in forest ecosystems.\nUrban Expansion Esch et al., 2017 applied Sentinel data to assess urban sprawl and its environmental impacts. This study leveraged high-resolution imagery to map human settlements and analyze urban footprint expansion globally.\nAgriculture and Crop Monitoring Zhang et al., 2016 used both Landsat and Sentinel-2 data to monitor crop health and predict agricultural outputs. The study focused on satellite-based climate data records to observe crop phenology, employing spectral analysis to assess vegetation health.\n\n\nthe reviewed studiesthe importance of spectral analysis and change detection in environmental monitoring.\nThe use of Sentinel and Landsat data as primary sources for remote sensing analysis is a common thread, highlighting their utility in tracking changes over time across various ecosystems.\nAdvanced techniques such as downscaling for super-resolution imaging and the application of spectral indices for enhanced analysis are discussed, showcasing the evolution of remote sensing methodologies.\n\nThe studies reveal a progression from foundational remote sensing techniques towards more sophisticated and user-friendly analytical methods. Innovations in software and processing tools have expanded the capabilities of researchers to analyze and interpret environmental data, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of remote sensing analyses.\n\n\n5 Reflection\nThroughout this session on remote sensing, I’ve learned the importance and application of satellite data in environmental monitoring. Understanding the differences between Landsat and Sentinel datasets and how to process these images in software like QGIS and SNAP has opened up new avenues for analyzing geographical information. The practical applications, from forest monitoring to urban planning, have shown me the vast potential of remote sensing data. Reflecting on this, I see immense value in applying these techniques to future projects, particularly in urban sustainability and climate change mitigation efforts. The resources provided, especially the detailed instructions for data processing, have enriched my understanding and skills in remote sensing, paving the way for innovative research and application in my future work.\n\n\n6 References\n\nCoppin, P., & Bauer, M.
