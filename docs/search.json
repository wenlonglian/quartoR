I did not realise how much it is used for, and it has inspired me to look into using it for my own research. It also made me look into certain data sources I have used before which I did not realise were created in part using remote sensing data. In particular, the data from WorldPop (one of the things I really liked about Southampton!), where they estimate populations by combining land cover, night time imagery and vegetation with other data and geospatial sources to produce a random forest regression tree model – really cool! I find it interesting how remotely sensed data can be manipulated to show different things and to highlight certain features of the land surface. In future I would like to use remotely sensed data in my dissertation, especially as it involves climate change where specific environmental factors will be included.",

The lecture covered policies on addressing urban heating and how RS can be used into monitoring heating and improving planning like tree planting etc.\n\n\n8 Application\nIn exploring the application of remote sensing and analysis methods in urban heating and policy, several studies have demonstrated innovative uses and adaptations of these methodologies. A study by Clara Cruz-Ramos et al. (2021) utilized Gabor texture features and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for land-cover classification of urban hyperspectral images, showcasing an innovative approach to compress data features while maintaining classification accuracy, which could be pivotal for urban planning and environmental monitoring (Cruz-Ramos et al., 2021). This method’s emphasis on data compression and efficient classification mirrors the analytical techniques discussed in our course, highlighting the importance of precision and efficiency in remote sensing applications.\nSimilarly, Johannes H. Uhl et al. (2021) proposed a framework that integrates remote-sensing-derived data with historical maps to generate historical urban extents, offering a novel perspective on assessing urbanization and land cover change over the long term (Uhl et al., 2021). This approach not only underscores the potential of combining different data sources for enhanced urban analysis but also aligns with the course’s focus on innovative data integration techniques for urban studies.\n\n\n9 Reflection\nReflecting on Lecture 5, I am fascinated by the potential of remote sensing data to influence policy-making on addressing urban heating. In class, we were presented many intersting videos about how policies interact with environment and local people, and how a RS project is like which help us a lot with the final presentation.\n\n\n10 Reference\nCruz-Ramos, C., Garcia Salgado, B.P., Reyes-Reyes, R., Ponomaryov, V., & Sadovnychiy, S.

    "section": "8.2 Application",
    "text": "8.2 Application\nThe application of GLCM texture measures in remote sensing has been extensively explored in recent literature, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in various domains. For instance, Varish et al. (2023) introduced an innovative texture feature extraction technique for radar remote sensing image retrieval, leveraging adaptive tetrolet transform alongside GLCM features. This approach significantly enhanced the retrieval accuracy of radar images by capturing fine texture information (Varish et al., 2023).\nIn another study, Lu et al. (2021) focused on the optimal segmentation scale selection for cultivated land objects in high-resolution remote sensing images, incorporating spectral and texture features. Their methodology, which included GLCM-based texture analysis, proved to be more precise than traditional methods, showcasing the importance of texture features in enhancing segmentation accuracy (Lu et al., 2021).\nMohammadpour et al. (2022) utilized GLCM texture features along with Sentinel-2 data for vegetation mapping in Portugal. By integrating texture features with multispectral bands and vegetation indices, they achieved high classification accuracy, highlighting the added value of texture analysis in remote sensing applications (Mohammadpour et al., 2022).\nThese studies collectively underscore the innovative applications of GLCM texture measures in remote sensing, ranging from image retrieval and land segmentation to vegetation mapping. They reveal a trend towards integrating texture features with other data types (e.g., spectral bands, vegetation indices) to enhance analysis accuracy and applicability.",

The process of converting surface reflectance values into a format suitable for texture analysis, and the strategic selection of neighborhood size for GLCM, were particularly enlightening. These steps are crucial for capturing the nuanced texture characteristics of the Earth’s surface, which can significantly impact the accuracy of remote sensing analyses.\nThe literature review further solidified my appreciation for the versatility of GLCM texture measures. Seeing how researchers have applied these measures across different domains, from radar image retrieval to vegetation mapping, has been truly inspiring. It’s fascinating to observe the innovation in methodology, such as integrating texture features with spectral data, to push the boundaries of what’s possible in remote sensing.\nLooking forward, I’m excited about the potential applications of GLCM texture measures in my future work. Whether it’s enhancing land cover classification accuracy or exploring new domains of environmental monitoring, the insights gained from this session will undoubtedly serve as a valuable foundation. The intersection of texture analysis with other remote sensing techniques opens up a realm of possibilities for more nuanced and comprehensive environmental assessments.",

    "text": "7.2 Application\nThe application of GLCM texture measures in remote sensing has been extensively explored in recent literature, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in various domains. For instance, Varish et al. (2023) introduced an innovative texture feature extraction technique for radar remote sensing image retrieval, leveraging adaptive tetrolet transform alongside GLCM features. This approach significantly enhanced the retrieval accuracy of radar images by capturing fine texture information (Varish et al., 2023).\nIn another study, Lu et al. (2021) focused on the optimal segmentation scale selection for cultivated land objects in high-resolution remote sensing images, incorporating spectral and texture features. Their methodology, which included GLCM-based texture analysis, proved to be more precise than traditional methods, showcasing the importance of texture features in enhancing segmentation accuracy (Lu et al., 2021).\nMohammadpour et al. (2022) utilized GLCM texture features along with Sentinel-2 data for vegetation mapping in Portugal. By integrating texture features with multispectral bands and vegetation indices, they achieved high classification accuracy, highlighting the added value of texture analysis in remote sensing applications (Mohammadpour et al., 2022).\nThese studies collectively underscore the innovative applications of GLCM texture measures in remote sensing, ranging from image retrieval and land segmentation to vegetation mapping. They reveal a trend towards integrating texture features with other data types (e.g., spectral bands, vegetation indices) to enhance analysis accuracy and applicability.",

    "text": "9.1 Reflection\nReflecting on this session, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of the significance of texture analysis in remote sensing, particularly through the lens of GLCM texture measures. The process of converting surface reflectance values into a format suitable for texture analysis, and the strategic selection of neighborhood size for GLCM, were particularly enlightening. These steps are crucial for capturing the nuanced texture characteristics of the Earth’s surface, which can significantly impact the accuracy of remote sensing analyses.\nThe literature review further solidified my appreciation for the versatility of GLCM texture measures. Seeing how researchers have applied these measures across different domains, from radar image retrieval to vegetation mapping, has been truly inspiring. It’s fascinating to observe the innovation in methodology, such as integrating texture features with spectral data, to push the boundaries of what’s possible in remote sensing.\nLooking forward, I’m excited about the potential applications of GLCM texture measures in my future work. Whether it’s enhancing land cover classification accuracy or exploring new domains of environmental monitoring, the insights gained from this session will undoubtedly serve as a valuable foundation. The intersection of texture analysis with other remote sensing techniques opens up a realm of possibilities for more nuanced and comprehensive environmental assessments.",

This literature review delves into recent advancements and applications of SAR in remote sensing, highlighting the innovative methodologies and their implications for various fields which aboaden our views to different fields could SAR be applied to apart from war destructions.\n\nF. Cigna et al. (2023) demonstrate the application of SAR in archaeological prospection and heritage site protection. Utilizing medium to very high-resolution imagery, the study highlights SAR’s capability in detecting buried archaeological features and assessing threats to cultural heritage, thereby contributing to the conservation of archaeological sites (Cigna et al., 2023).\nMinhwa Kim et al. (2023) address the challenge of detecting earthquake-induced building damages using temporal SAR data with different observation modes. Their contextual change analysis method, based on novel textural features, showcases the adaptability of SAR in disaster response, particularly in earthquake-affected areas (Kim et al., 2023).\nSang-Eun Park et al. (2020) focus on the detection of earthquake-induced building damages using polarimetric SAR data. Their study evaluates the practical applicability of polarimetric observations for damage assessment, proposing a novel change detection method that significantly enhances the detection accuracy of damaged areas (Park et al., 2020).\n\nThese studies collectively illustrate the versatility and innovation in SAR applications, from enhancing image readability and archaeological prospection to disaster response and damage assessment. The integration of advanced algorithms and deep learning techniques with SAR data opens new avenues for remote sensing applications, promising greater accuracy and efficiency in environmental monitoring, cultural heritage protection, and disaster management.",
