# Summary

This week, we delved into the critical aspects of **Classification** in remotely sensing cities and environments. We have two lectures this week, about *Classification and Accuracy*, provided a comprehensive overview of how remote sensing technologies can be applied to classify and analyze various environmental and urban parameters.

## Lecture 6: Classification

The lecture introduced the concept of classification in remote sensing, including **Decision tree, rANDOM FOREST and SVM **,focusing on the methodologies and applications of classifying satellite imagery into different land cover types. This process is crucial for understanding the composition of various landscapes and urban areas.



## practical result
In GEE the supervised classifiers include: CART, RandomForest, NaiveBayes and SVM. This practical ,we use CART and RF to train our data.

I encountered problem when it came to RF training.I first drew polygons but it turned out beyond computing capacity. So I had to narrow my training area, I might take some place where land use type are mixed. So it turns out that RF accuracy was bad. But I think in some extent, it emphasize the importance of different image analysis methods(OBIA,subpixels)

# Application

These literature reveal the diverse applications of Sentinel-2 data in environmental monitoring, showcasing the satellite's versatility and the innovative methodologies employed in recent studies:

- **Land Cover/Use Mapping**: Phiri et al. (2020) conducted a comprehensive review of Sentinel-2's contribution to land cover/use classification, highlighting its high spatial resolution and the effectiveness of **machine-learning classifiers** like SVM and Random Forest in achieving high accuracies. This study underscores Sentinel-2's potential in monitoring crops, forests, urban areas, and water resources ([Remote. Sens., 12, 2291](https://consensus.app/papers/sentinel2-data-land-coveruse-mapping-review-phiri/448b285c2da15b67883a7874b63f068b/)).

- **Wetlands Monitoring**: Pena-Regueiro et al. (2020) demonstrated Sentinel-2's capability in detecting small water bodies within wetlands, employing the NDWI index to monitor environmental changes effectively. This application is crucial for understanding wetland dynamics and managing water resources ([Water](https://consensus.app/papers/sentinel2-application-surface-characterization-small-penaregueiro/39b15b5947285e68a060c8336c8cac04/).

- **Drought Assessment**: Varghese et al. (2021) reviewed the potential of Sentinel-2 in assessing drought through various parameters such as vegetation characteristics and soil moisture. The study highlights Sentinel-2's advantages over other data sources like Landsat and MODIS in drought analysis, emphasizing its spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics ([Remote. Sens., 13, 3355](https://consensus.app/papers/reviewing-potential-sentinel2-assessing-drought-varghese/1af1b718985d5f2499bda444f3e13d10/)).

These studies illustrate more applications in different area, the innovative use of Sentinel-2 data in addressing different types of environmental challenges, reflecting on the classification methods and tools discussed in the course. The integration of machine learning and index-based approaches for data analysis demonstrates the evolving landscape of remote sensing applications.The CART and RF classification methods can go further in these cases.

# Reflection

Reflecting on the remote sensing course, I've gained invaluable insights into the power and potential of remote sensing technologies. I got to learn more multi-tool using, like how GEE can be combined with machine learning, how data should be classfied? I am particularly intrigued by the potential of remote sensing in environmental conservation, such as monitoring deforestation and predicting flood risks. These applications demonstrate how remote sensing data, when accurately classified and analyzed, can be a powerful tool in making informed decisions and implementing effective solutions.And I also think the error I made in practical can erose deep thinking about how the image classification works exactly.
